## Problem Statement
Write a Program which behaves as prescribed in the below problem statement
- Take input/output as specified 
- Print the expected output using the expected logic/algorithm/data
- Code is structured correctly and according to the problem statement

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach

## Example
	Inputs: 
		variable1 = input1 
		variable2 = input2 
		/* Solution Logic according to asked problem statement */ 
		Expected Output = As described in the problem statement

## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
	int i = 0;
	int j = 0 ;

	for (int k =0; k < i; k++) {
		printf("this is my hint logic %d", i);
	}
